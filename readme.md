Team Name: Godzilla
Problem Statement: COVID-19 has lead to a lot of boredom. Among Us has helped fill that void. However, in Among Us, you can't find previous friends that you played with to easily play with them again. You have to ask for their Discord, Instagram, or phone number to be able to send them your room code. You also can't filter by game settings besides the map and number of imposters. You have to join the lobby to figure out the game settings and leave if they aren't to your desires. You also have to refresh the servers to just find a lobby that isn't full.
Proposal: Godzilla will create a website to help Among Us users catalog friends so that you don't have to give that imposter your phone number. The website will also allow users to filter through settings such as Confirm Ejects, Anonymous Votes,  Player Speed, and Visual Tasks so that the mystery can continue, your voter privacy protected, your ship walls hole-free, and your wires in a row. Users can also create a post detailing game settings, current number of players, and the lobby's game code so that lobby refresh rates are lowered. Our website will help connect fellow Among Us players so that that task bar can keep being filled up.
